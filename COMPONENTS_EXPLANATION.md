# Components & Architecture Explanation

## Issue Found & Fixed 

### Problem: Book Appointment Button Not Working Correctly
**Symptom**: Clicking 'Book Appointment' would open location dialog, but after selecting location, it would NOT redirect to /book page.

**Root Cause**: LocationHandler component was missing redirect logic after location selection.

**Solution**: 
- Added \edirectAfterSelection\ prop to LocationHandler
- Updated both \handleManualCitySelection\ and \handleContinueWithService\ to redirect after setting location
- Passed \edirectAfterSelection='/book'\ from home page

## HOCs (Higher-Order Components) Explained

### What are HOCs?
HOCs are wrapper components that add authentication/authorization logic. They're security guards for your pages.

### Why Use HOCs?
- **Security**: Prevent unauthorized access to protected pages
- **Code Reuse**: Don't repeat auth logic on every page
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep auth logic separate from page logic
- **User Experience**: Automatic redirects instead of showing errors

---

## Your HOCs

### 1. AuthGuard (components/auth-guard.tsx)
**Purpose**: Ensures user is logged in (or not logged in)

**Use Cases**:
- Profile page (must be logged in)
- Bookings page (must be logged in)  
- Sign-in page (must NOT be logged in - redirects if already logged in)

**How it works**:
\\\	ypescript
// Require authentication (default)
<AuthGuard>
  <ProfilePage />
</AuthGuard>

// Require NO authentication (login/signup pages)
<AuthGuard requireAuth={false}>
  <SignInPage />
</AuthGuard>
\\\

**What it does**:
1. Checks if user has valid Supabase session
2. If \equireAuth=true\ and no user  redirect to /auth/signin
3. If \equireAuth=false\ and user exists  redirect to home
4. Shows loading spinner while checking
5. Listens for auth state changes (logout, login)

---

### 2. AdminGuard (components/admin-guard.tsx)
**Purpose**: Ensures user is an admin

**Use Cases**:
- Admin dashboard
- Admin tables/stats pages
- User management pages

**How it works**:
\\\	ypescript
<AdminGuard>
  <AdminDashboard />
</AdminGuard>
\\\

**What it does**:
1. Calls \/api/admin/mvp-verify\ to check JWT token
2. Token stored in \mvp_admin\ cookie
3. If not admin or no token  redirect to /admin/login
4. Shows loading spinner while checking

**Security**: Uses JWT tokens, not Supabase sessions (separate admin auth system)

---

### 3. PartnerGuard (components/partner-guard.tsx)
**Purpose**: Ensures user is a partner (diagnostic center)

**Use Cases**:
- Partner dashboard
- Partner onboarding
- Center management
- Service management

**How it works**:
\\\	ypescript
<PartnerGuard>
  <PartnerDashboard />
</PartnerGuard>
\\\

**What it does**:
1. Checks for development mode partner (localStorage)
2. Gets current Supabase user
3. Checks user role in \users\ table
4. If role !== 'partner'  redirect to /partner/login
5. Shows loading spinner while checking

**Special**: Has dev mode support for testing

## Component Hierarchy

\\\
app/
 page.tsx (Home - No guard needed, public)
 profile/page.tsx (Protected by AuthGuard)
 bookings/page.tsx (Protected by AuthGuard)
 admin/
    layout.tsx (Contains AdminGuard)
    dashboard/page.tsx
 partner/
    layout.tsx (Contains PartnerGuard)
    dashboard/page.tsx
 auth/
     signin/page.tsx (Protected by AuthGuard with requireAuth=false)
\\\

## Why Guards in Layouts vs Pages?

### Layout Guards (admin, partner)
- Guards entire section at once
- All child pages automatically protected
- More efficient (single check for multiple pages)

### Page Guards (profile, bookings)
- Individual pages need protection
- Different pages might have different redirect logic
- More flexible for mixed public/private sections

---

## Security Benefits

1. **Server-Side Protection**: Guards run client-side, but API routes have their own auth checks
2. **Multiple Layers**: Both client guards AND server API validation
3. **Role-Based Access**: Different guards for different user types
4. **Session Management**: Automatic logout handling
5. **Redirect Logic**: Smart redirects based on auth state

---

## Testing Your Guards

### Test AuthGuard
1. Go to /profile without logging in  Should redirect to /auth/signin
2. Log in, go to /auth/signin  Should redirect to home
3. Log out while on /profile  Should redirect to /auth/signin

### Test AdminGuard  
1. Log in as customer, try to access /admin  Should redirect to /admin/login
2. Log in as admin  Should access /admin/dashboard

### Test PartnerGuard
1. Log in as customer, try to access /partner  Should redirect to /partner/login
2. Log in as partner  Should access /partner/dashboard

---

## Fixed Flow: Book Appointment

### Before (Broken):
1. Click 'Book Appointment'
2. Location dialog opens
3. Select location
4. Dialog closes
5. **User stays on home page** 

### After (Fixed):
1. Click 'Book Appointment'  
2. Location dialog opens
3. Select location
4. Dialog closes
5. **User redirected to /book page**

## Key Takeaways

1. **HOCs = Security Guards** - They protect pages from unauthorized access
2. **Multiple Guard Types** - Different guards for different user roles
3. **Client + Server** - Guards on client, auth checks on API too
4. **Automatic Redirects** - Better UX than showing errors
5. **Reusable Logic** - Write once, use everywhere

## Files Modified

1. \/components/location-handler.tsx\ - Added redirect logic
2. \/app/page.tsx\ - Added redirectAfterSelection prop
