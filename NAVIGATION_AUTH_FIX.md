# Navigation/Auth Display Fix - RESOLVED

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Issue:** User profile/avatar not showing in navigation after successful OAuth login
**Status:**  FIXED

---

## Problem

After successfully logging in with Google OAuth:
-  User was authenticated (session working)
-  Login successful in terminal logs
-  Navigation bar showed "Sign In" button instead of user avatar
-  User appeared not logged in on the frontend

---

## Root Cause

Multiple client-side components were using the **old Supabase client** (`lib/supabaseClient.ts`) which:
-  Doesn't support cookie-based sessions
-  Can't read auth cookies set by OAuth flow
-  Always returns "no user" even when user is logged in

**Affected Components:**
1. `components/navigation.tsx` - Main navigation with user avatar
2. `components/auth-guard.tsx` - Route protection
3. `components/partner-guard.tsx` - Partner route protection  
4. `components/booking-flow.tsx` - Booking authentication check

---

## Solution

Updated all client-side components to use the **new browser client** (`lib/supabase-browser.ts`) which:
-  Uses `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr`
-  Properly reads auth cookies
-  Works with Next.js App Router
-  Supports OAuth session management

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `components/navigation.tsx`
**Before:**
```typescript
import supabase from "@/lib/supabaseClient" //  No cookie support
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase-browser" //  Cookie support!
const supabase = createClient()
```

### 2. `components/auth-guard.tsx`
**Before:**
```typescript
import supabase from "@/lib/supabaseClient"
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase-browser"
const supabase = createClient()
```

### 3. `components/partner-guard.tsx`
Same update as above

### 4. `components/booking-flow.tsx`
Same update as above

## What's Working Now

-  User profile/avatar displays in navigation after login
-  Dropdown menu shows user name and email
-  "My Bookings" and "Profile" links visible
-  "Sign Out" button working
-  Auth guards properly detect logged-in users
-  Booking flow recognizes authenticated users
-  Session persists across page refreshes

---

## Testing

**Before Fix:**
- User logs in successfully
- Navigation still shows "Sign In" button
- User avatar not visible

**After Fix:**
- User logs in successfully
- Navigation shows user avatar with dropdown
- Full name and email displayed
- Profile and bookings accessible

---

## Key Points

1. **Two Supabase Clients Coexist:**
   - `lib/supabaseClient.ts` - Server-side operations (admin, database)
   - `lib/supabase-browser.ts` - Client-side auth (user sessions)

2. **When to Use Each:**
   - Use `supabase-browser.ts` for: User auth, session checks, OAuth
   - Use `supabaseClient.ts` for: Server-side API routes, admin operations

3. **All Client Components Using Auth:**
   Must use `createClient()` from `lib/supabase-browser.ts`

---

##  Status: PRODUCTION READY

User profile display and authentication detection now fully functional across all client-side components.

**Test Results:**
- Login  Avatar visible 
- Dropdown menu works 
- Sign out works 
- Auth guards work 
- Booking flow detects auth 

**No further action required.**
